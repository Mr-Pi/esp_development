# ESP development

This repository provides a simple script `dev.sh` to make the development for the ESP8266 or the ESP32 a bit more handful.

After you cloned this repository you need to run `./dev.sh install` once to initiate the SDK and to download the official espressif toolchain.


# USAGE

Simple run `./dev.sh` without argument to see all avail options.


# HINTS

Add `$PS1_EXPAND` anywhere to your shell PROMPT/PS1 in your local `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. This will show you in indicator, when developing :) .
